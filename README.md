# UBC-Science-Case-Competition-2022

App Development: EcoCanada


What are the issues?
- Decline in level of natural conservation
- Increasing number of foreign visitors
- Increased by around 4% per year [2.1]
- Foregin visitors may have different cultural background and belief about the environment

Human activities?
- Littering 
- Undergoing commercial development



Our solution:
- Education-> associated with the environment  
- Live Stream & AR-> an alternative way to experience the nature
- Geofencing-> visitor trends, predictive analyses with big data
- Social Media Platform->  society awareness
- Funds-> support environmental protection

Education:
- Biological and Ecological Knowledge
- Canadian Law Policy
- Local Indigenous Culture
- Knowledge Quiz
  Allow visitors to strengthen their memory
  Reward (coupon) will be given after quiz which can also promote commercial development in the area.

Live Stream:
- Zoom in from the map to watch live stream
- Help staff monitoring and managing
- Decrease contact in COVID-19 situation

AR Virtual Reality:
- Project animation of selected animals to the camera
- Interact with the animation

Geofencing:
- Can view the overcrowdedness of park areas and adjust their routes accordingly
- Understanding of visitor mobility and behavior allow for predictive analyses using big data

Social Media Platform:
- A Discussion Section 
- Updating current information 
- Posting photos
- Reduce amounts of visitors
- An Environmental Friendly Activity
  Motivate visitors to participate into this activity
  More than 25,000 posts about collecting trashes were made during the trashtag trend
  
Funding:
- Merchants cooperation
- Donations from visitors
- Parks construction
- Biodiversity conservation

Challenge and Conclusion:
- App development is difficult (implementation of AR and geofencing, device compatibility and performance)
- Privacy concern (the ownership of the data)
- Need promotion in the beginning stage
